Car race in OpenGL

This is a program written in the OpenGL programming interface.The code contains the functions that accomplish all the tasks required for the project. It can be further improved upon to provide better facilities and user interface.
We intend to introduce usage of graphic system on gaming. Various functions are used with different functionalities  in the code to implement the game. The program shows a realistic view of cars and objects. The car is moved according to the rules of the game depending on the difficulty mode selected by the player with different views. The motive of the game is to drive the car as long as possible. A track of the score is maintained based the number of obstacles or disturbance passed while playing. When the car crash with obstacle, the game ends and the final score is displayed.
OpenGL bases on the state variables. There are many values, for example the color, that remain after being specified. That means, you can specify a color once and draw several polygons, lines or what ever with this color then. There are no classes like in DirectX. However, it is logically structured.
The OpenGL graphics package is aimed at supporting the requirements of the Computer Graphics package. The editor has been implemented under the OPENGL environment using the VISUALSTUDIO C++ package using the C++ as the language tool. The various features have been supported by an easy way to understand mouse interface. The work is carried out in the main window.
